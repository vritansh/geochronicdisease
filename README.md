2. read.csv(file = '/Users/vritansh/Downloads/CDC.csv') 

This file contains filtered data it should be replaced with the below file ( Columbia Access Available) ( Please download CDC.csv)

3. Any other files in the documnet with the name : USChronicDiseases.csv need to be replaced with the one's mentioned in #1 

Chronic diseases are an important public health problem, which can result in morbidity, mortality, disability, and decreased quality of life. Chronic diseases represented seven of the top 10 causes of death in the United States in 2010 (Murphy SL, Xu J, Kochanek KD. Deaths: final data for 2010. Natl Vital Stat Rep 2013;6. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/ nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf). Chronic diseases and risk factors vary by geographic area such as state and county, where essential public health interventions are implemented. The chronic disease indicators (CDIs) were established in the late 1990s through collaboration among CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the Association of State and Territorial Chronic Disease Program Directors (now the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors) to enable public health professionals and policymakers to retrieve data for chronic diseases and risk factors that have a substantial impact on public health. Chronic diseases are an important public health problem, which can result in morbidity, mortality, disability, and decreased quality of life. Chronic diseases represented seven of the top 10 causes of death in the United States in 2010 (1). Diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms (cancers), chronic lower respiratory disease, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and kidney disease (nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis) together accounted for 65.8% of all deaths among U.S. males and 67.2% of all deaths among U.S. females in 2010 (2). Chronic disease risk factors, including smoking, poor diet, insufficient physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol consumption, were the leading actual causes of death in 2000 (3)
