[["index.html", "Geospatial Analysis of Chronic Diseases Chapter 1 Introduction", " Geospatial Analysis of Chronic Diseases Vritansh Kamal (vk2501), Ritvik Khandelwal (rk3213), Maria Pratyusha (mp4145) 2022-12-16 Chapter 1 Introduction Chronic diseases are conditions that last 1 year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both. The most common chronic diseases especially in adults are heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, epilepsy, tooth decay, and chronic kidney disease. This can be caused by risk behaviors like tobacco use and exposure to passive smoke, poor nutrition, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol use. Six in ten adults in the US have a chronic disease and four out of ten from that lot have more than two.[1] Given the advance in the healthcare industry following the pandemic we’ve chosen to study chronic diseases in the USA over the last decade. The dataset we’re using is taken from CDC [2] which consists of a record of people suffering from chronic diseases since 2001. It also provides us useful indicators on the geographies of these chronic diseases therefore would help us to dive into the geospatial analysis of the same. The data on chronic diseases gives us insights on the evolution of a particular disease over the time and in different geographical localities. It also serves as a major indicator of the health of the community in a particular geolocation based on the extent of the spread of the disease. This is where we see the true potential in exploring the data for analysis and visualization to deduce any reasonable assumption about the same backed by scientific proof such as news articles, hospitalization records etc. This can help us to formulate better policies based on our analysis and help to advance healthcare by investing in the same.

To make it useful and discernable for the public, we have decided to perform a thorough exploratory data analysis through interactive visualizations thus enabling us to infer valuable insights/information from the data available to us. The columns we are planning to use are YearStart (Year Start) / YearEnd (Year End) - Intend to merge these 2 columns to make a single column named “Year” as the values of YearStart and YearEnd is the same in every row LocationAbbr (Location Abbreviation) - Short form abbreviations of the locations. Useful for neat plots LocationDec (Location description) - full forms of Location Abbreviations column Data Source - Source from which the particular data point is collected Topic - Name of the disease stratification Category1 - consisting of race, ethnicity, overall categories Stratification1 - The respective values of stratification Category1 column is contained in this column GeoLocation - The geographic Location of the particular data point. Useful for Geospatial Analysis Insights that can be potentially inferred or questions that we can potentially answer through analyzing the data: Q - Spread of topic based on the geospatial data and location. can be done for every year to understand which locations are susceptible or improving with respect to a particular topic in each year. Q - Which gender is more prone to get affected by a specific topic? Q - patterns between year/time and topic (highest, lowest, etc). Q - Are there states where males/females getting affected more? Q - States which are dealing with the most number of topics. Can try to infer which countries are more suitable to live because of less number of topics that they are dealing with? 2.2 Data availability The data source we are leveraging is taken from data.gov [2]. This dataset is provided and maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) division of population health. This dataset was first published on 21st Feb 2021 and the last update was done on 24th March 2022. It is a publicly available dataset and is licensed by ODBL.[3] There are about 124 indicators that are provided by the CDC’s Division of Population Health that allows states and territories and large metropolitan areas to uniformly define, collect and report chronic disease data which are integral to public health practice. In addition to providing access to state-specific indicator data, the CDI website serves as a gateway to supplementary information and data resources. Public health authorities require access to the most pertinent, recent, and consistently characterized chronic illness surveillance data at the state and county level in order to monitor diseases and risk factors throughout time and to plan and implement effective treatments. The National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD), the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborated to develop the chronic disease indicators (CDIs), a collection of surveillance indicators that is accessible online.Public health experts and decision-makers can access the CDI website to receive universally defined state-level and chosen metropolitan-level statistics for chronic illnesses and risk factors that significantly affect public health. The monitoring, prioritizing, and evaluation of public health interventions for chronic illness depend on these variables. Most of the current indicators, if not all of them, are accessible and provided on other websites, either by the data sources or by categorized chronic illness programs. The CDI website, on the other hand, is the sole complete source with full access to a variety of indicators for the surveillance of chronic illnesses, conditions, and risk factors at the state level and for specific big metropolitan regions. Multiple primary surveillance data sources are used to acquire CDI data. The expansion of the CDI set necessitates the inclusion of new sources of data. Previously, the CDIs relied on data from nine primary registries, the American Community Survey (ACS), birth and death certificates data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), the State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation System, the United States Renal Data System, and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. The revised CDIs retain the use of data from these sources, and additional data will be obtained from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, the Alcohol Epidemiologic Data System, the Alcohol Policy Information System, alcohol policy legal research, the National Survey of Children’s Health, State Emergency Department Databases, State Inpatient Databases, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chronic Condition Warehouse and the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the CDC School Health Profiles, Achieving a State of Healthy Weight, Maternal Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care, the Breastfeeding Report Card, the Health Resources and Services Administration Uniform Data System, the National Immunization Survey, and the Water Fluoridation Reporting System. Many of these, such as BRFSS, use complex sampling designs and weights that must be taken into account. Additional details on these data sources are provided (Table 4) of this paper. [4] The data is in the form of a Comma Separated Values file so we have basically downloaded this file on our local machine and plan to import it locally by reading the csv in R. After that we will proceed to perform further analysis. 2.3 References [1] https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/center/index.htm#.

The attributes that we focus on for this project are: YearStart : Year in which the chronic disease was recorded. LocationAbbr : State associated with the chronic disease. DataSource : Contributors for the survey conducted to record the chronic diseases. Topic : Name of the chronic disease. Question : Indicators associated with a chronic disease, for example - Mortality, Binge Consumption, etc,. DataValue : Population that have been affected by a specific indicator. Stratification1 : Describes the gender or race of an individual. GeoLocation : The latitude and longitude points at which the data was collected. We observe that there are several redundant columns and multiple columns with null values. Since we can’t work directly with this dataset, we analyze the missing values and then transform the data into it’s usable form. 3.2 Missing value analysis Now to begin with missing value analysis we first check the percentage of missing values in the initial dataset. Please note here that we are referring to the initial dataset as the original dataset with only the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021. Sine there were many null string values in the dataset we converted them to NA before calculating the percentage of missing values in each column. ## YearStart YearEnd LocationAbbr ## 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## LocationDesc DataSource Topic ## 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## Question Response DataValueUnit ## 0.0000000 100.0000000 5.6512846 ## DataValueType DataValue DataValueAlt ## 0.0000000 32.5825449 32.8883200 ## DataValueFootnoteSymbol DatavalueFootnote LowConfidenceLimit ## 66.4704987 66.4704987 39.1536242 ## HighConfidenceLimit StratificationCategory1 Stratification1 ## 39.1536242 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## StratificationCategory2 Stratification2 StratificationCategory3 ## 100.0000000 100.0000000 100.0000000 ## Stratification3 GeoLocation ResponseID ## 100.0000000 0.6938586 100.0000000 ## LocationID TopicID QuestionID ## 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## DataValueTypeID StratificationCategoryID1 StratificationID1 ## 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## StratificationCategoryID2 StratificationID2 StratificationCategoryID3 ## 100.0000000 100.0000000 100.0000000 ## StratificationID3 ## 100.0000000 From the above, we can observe that we have missing values in the following columns: Response, DataValueUnit, DataValue, DataValueAlt, DataValueFootnoteSymbol, DatavalueFootnote, LowConfidenceLimit, HighConfidenceLimit, StratificationCategory2, Stratification2, StratificationCategory3, Stratification3, GeoLocation, ResponseID, StratificationCategoryID2, StratificationID2, StratificationCategoryID3, StratificationID3. For the purpose of the further analysis we straightaway dropped columns like - Response, StratificationCategory2, Stratification2, StratificationCategory3, Stratification3, ResponseID, StratificationCategoryID2, StratificationID2, StratificationCategoryID3, StratificationID3. We did so as they had 100% of the values missing so keeping them would only add more noise to our plots as they serve no useful meaning. In addition to the above, we also dropped the colummns: DataValueFootnoteSymbol, DatavalueFootnote as these columns have significant (~66%) number of missing values and served no useful purpose for our analysis. Now we recalculate the number of missing values in each column to get an idea of what we have after the above transformations. ## X YearStart YearEnd ## 0 0 0 ## LocationAbbr LocationDesc DataSource ## 0 0 0 ## Topic Question DataValueUnit ## 0 0 139390 ## DataValueType DataValue DataValueAlt ## 0 353093 355136 ## LowConfidenceLimit HighConfidenceLimit StratificationCategory1 ## 465077 465077 0 ## Stratification1 GeoLocation LocationID ## 0 9196 0 ## TopicID QuestionID DataValueTypeID ## 0 0 0 ## StratificationCategoryID1 StratificationID1 ## 0 0 To get a better idea about the distribution of the missing values, we plot several types of graphs. This also help us understand patterns between different missing values, if any. We begin with plotting a vertical bar chart From the above Bar Chart we can infer that DataValue and DataValueAlt have same number of missing values. Similarly, the columns HighConfidenceLimit and LowConfidenceLimit have equal number of missing values. Perhaps, there is a correlation between them? Before we arrive to this conclusion, let us take look through some more visualizations. ## X YearStart YearEnd ## 0 0 0 ## LocationAbbr LocationDesc DataSource ## 0 0 0 ## Topic Question DataValueUnit ## 0 0 139390 ## DataValueType DataValue DataValueAlt ## 0 353093 355136 ## LowConfidenceLimit HighConfidenceLimit StratificationCategory1 ## 465077 465077 0 ## Stratification1 GeoLocation LocationID ## 0 9196 0 ## TopicID QuestionID DataValueTypeID ## 0 0 0 ## StratificationCategoryID1 StratificationID1 ## 0 0 B - Year start C - Year end D - Location Abbreviation E - location description F - Data Source G - Topic H - Question I - DataValueUnit J - DataValueType K - DataValue L - DataValueAlt M - LowConfidenceLimit N - HighConfidenceLimit O - StratificationCategory1 P - Stratification1 Q - Geolocation R - LocationID S - TopicID T - QuestionID U - DataValueTypeID V - StratificationCategoryID1 W - StratificationID1 The above graph gives a more different view to visualize the distribution of missing values. The Variable on the X-axis are the columns. We have one plot where we get an idea of the number of rows missing in each column. Then we have another plot which is giving us a pattern of the missing values in each column. The third plot gives us a more clear picture regarding the association of missing values with the row count. We calculated the percentage of missing values in the beginning but we did not do so after dropping the columns so to get a better idea of the percentage of missing values, we plot a horizontal bar chart. As expected, the above horizontal bar chart is consistent with the first bar chart that we made. The only difference here is that we have taken the percentage instead of the number of missing values. In addition to that, the above plot is much more visually appealing and is arranged in ascending order to enable visual comparative analysis easily. So far, we had primarily been focussing on the columns. Therefore we now dive into the row level aspects. So now let is visualize the missing values in another way by plotting each row in the dataset to get further insights. The above visualization affirms that the LowConfidenceLimit and HighConfidenceLimit are indeed correlated. In fact they are most likely the same because the rows that have missing LowConfidenceLimit also have missing HighConfidenceLimit and vice versa. A similar conclusion can be made for DataValue and DataValueAlt. GeoLocation has been consistent in the sense that it has very few missing values. Since the above plots did not really take other columns (columns without missing values) into consideration, it can be difficult to gauge the relativity between columns that do not have missing values and the columns that have missing values. Therefore, the below plot shows all the columns. The bars filled with blue indicates the one’s having missing values therefore they are indicated as True. False indicates that the region does not have missing values.

"],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Topic Distribution 4.2 Gender Distribution 4.3 Graph Showing the Top Cardiovascular Diseases 4.4 Timeseries Faceted Geoplot", " Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Topic Distribution This plot shows the distribution of diseases across the country, It indicates that the number of people affected by “Cardiovascular Disease” is significantly higher in comparison with the rest of the prevalent diseases that include “Overarching Conditions”, “Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease”, “Diabetes”, and “Chronic Kidney Disease”. 4.2 Gender Distribution From the plot below, we estimate the number of females and males that have been affected by a specific disease. Key takeaways: 1. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD): About 2500000 males are affected by CVD whereas the number of females is around 2250000. 2. Chronic Kidney Disease: There is a very slight difference between the count of the male and female which is below 500000. 3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Disease: The ratio od male to female in this case in 1, which indicates equal number of males and females affected by this disease in the US. 4.Diabetes: The males affected is close to 500000 and the number of females is slighly over 450000. 5. Overarching Conditions: The male count is around 700000 and that of the female is lower than 500000. 4.3 Graph Showing the Top Cardiovascular Diseases 4.3.1 Geomap : Mortality due to Cardiovascular Diseases The plot shows the total count of the cardiovascular diseases across multiple states. The data belongs to the below topics and has been aggregated to provide complete picture. Questions [1] “Mortality from coronary heart disease” [2] “Mortality from total cardiovascular diseases” [3] “Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (stroke)” [4] “Mortality from diseases of the heart” [5] “Mortality from heart failure” States with highest mortality: Texas, New York, Illinois, California, Florida States with lowest mortality: Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah 4.3.2 Geomap : Mortality due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease The plot shows the total count of the cardiovascular diseases across multiple states. The data belongs to the below topics and has been aggregated to provide complete picture. Questions [1] “Mortality from coronary heart disease” [2] “Mortality from total cardiovascular diseases” [3] “Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (stroke)” [4] “Mortality from diseases of the heart” [5] “Mortality from heart failure” States with highest mortality: Texas, New York, Ohio, California, Florida States with lowest mortality: North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah, New Mexico 4.3.3 Geomap : Mortality due to Diabetes The plot shows the total count of the cardiovascular diseases across multiple states. The data belongs to the below topics and has been aggregated to provide complete picture. Questions [1] “Mortality with diabetic ketoacidosis reported as any listed cause of death” [2] “Mortality due to diabetes reported as any listed cause of death” States with highest mortality: Texas, New York, Ohio, California, Florida States with lowest mortality: Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah 4.4 Timeseries Faceted Geoplot In this plot we’re analyzing if the mortality chronic diseases have increased in the past decade. For this we’ve considerered the data for one decade on the top five states from above. This would give us insights on the health care and how people have evolved. It can be helpful in predicting useful information regarding infrastructure of a state. Key Trends: 1. Cardiovascular Disease Except for New York state, for all the states the mortality caused by cardiovascular disease has increased. 2. Diabetes in Texas As we can observe from the graph the mortality due to diabetes in Texas was ~69,000 in the year 2017, It increased close to 116,000 in 2018 and then took a dip in 2019 to ~72,000. 3. Data consistency for Diabetes Data As we observed in above point the data trend for diabetes data similar across other states as well. It can be accounted to the way data was collected. And this dip is only seen from 2017 to 2019. This trend is interesting as it could mean that from the years 2017 to 2019 information is either with errors or in actual these states had a dip in the mortality due to diabetes.

We need to observe the graphs to infer useful key points from them. The plots do a good work at explaining the depth of the data. However, sometimes it’s curcial to know how is the data distributed in the hierarchial order. It invovles exploring the data in a top down fashion. For instance, if we consider this use case. Where user wants to understand the distribution of the chronic diseases in every state. And under that distribution understand how the mortality of each disease is distributed in gender. The below graphs solves this problem. It involves starting from the State level, then navigating to the disease distribution and finally showing the gender. It gives clear and precise undertanding of the distribution of the data. 5.1 Exploring Hierarchies ( Click on bars to explore ) Load Data "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion The US Chronic Disease dataset consists of data from 2010 to 2022 for individuals affected with Chronic Diseases in the US. Key Takeaways: 1. We have modified the data by considering years from 2018 to 2021 to represent the COVID period, the Data Value Type has several categories hence, we have chosen number to represent the population. 2. Through missing value analysis we were able to identify column-wise and row-wise patterns among missing values in our dataset. This allowed us to make a more informed decision about the columns that are useful for further analysis and the columns that needed to be dropped. After transforming our data, we have focused on the top 5 diseases to understand the spread of diseases based on gender and that on different states. 3. Based on analyzing the topic distribution on the location, we were able to identify the top 5 states that have witnessed highest population affected with Chronic Diseases, which are Texas, New York, California, Ohio and Florida. 4. We showed hierarchies in d3 charts to understand the data interactively by digging into it . This gives us the spread of the data just on the click of a button Limitations: 1. The geolocation points for latitude and longitude are misleading and that needs to be optimized. 2. Data collected has many missing values that forces us to drop some features that might help in obtaining better insights. Future Implementation: 1. Data exploration gave us the opportunity to find the mortality in the U.S. The next step would be to identify the reason for high mortality in some states v.s the others. It would help us to understand how mortality ir linked to the lifestyle of an individual. It would involve the food habits of the individuals etc. 2. The next step would be to identify correlation among the questions. These questions tell specific information about the disease. How one disease can cause a ripple could help in analzying the same and finding in the dataset. This exploration can gives us the opportunity to come up with the policies which could have a potential impact on the diseases. 3. For instance, if we bring to light the reason for high diabetes caused due to factors such as being physically less active and over weight. We could make general public aware by publishing these findings to create awareness is the most important step in identifying the information. 4. We saw over the last decade the course hasn’t changed much. That means the problem is rooted to much deeper. We should try to explore more versions of this dataset to identify if there is some correlation from different data sources such as BFSS. Apart from mortality there are several other indicators accounting to 124. These could also be brought in to the picture to see correlation and provide reasoning for different values of the dataset in different variables.
